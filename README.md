# LogisticRegressionTutorial

This tutorial is for the basics of Logistic Regression. Here, I created a simulated dataset of binary class with two features. I used Gradient Descent to
update the parameter of the model. After that, I predicted the test value. I have drawn the decision boundary and described different aspects of the classification report. I also plotted the AUC_ROC curve. Feel free to contact me if anything is not understandable.
